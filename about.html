			<p>Family websites are created to unite people in different areas by providing a platform which enables communication of individuals in separate geographical locations to share memories and stories thus bringing families  closer to each other.
				To us family means putting your arms around each other and being there.	</p>
			<p>	Peace is the beauty of life. It is Sunshine. It is the smile of a child,the love of a mother, the joy of a father,
				the togetherness of a family. Our main go is to bring you home comfort even when you are hundreds of miles away from home. It's all about quality of life and finding a happy balance
				between work, friends and family. </p>
			<p>	Nothing is better than going home to family and eat good food and relax, even when you are away from home you can relax knowing that your family is safe even when you are at a business trip away from home. This site is designed for a father who is far away from his kids, a mother who's away on a trip or vacation but wants to chat and communicate with their family.
